# IA-proj2-FEUP
The task at hand is a supervised learning problem, where we want to learn how to classify cancer cells into benign or malignant based on 30 different features. The dataset consists of 570 cancer cells, and the goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify new, unseen cancer cells as either benign or malignant.

## Instructions:
Simply run the code blocks in the IART_proj2.ipynb file in order.
